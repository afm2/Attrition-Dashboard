# Attrition Dashboard with RStudio Shiny
## Alex Moore, December 2019

Using the publicly available HR Analytics Dataset created by IBM (https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset), I created a Dashboard which summarizes observed patterns in organizational attrition. 

The dashboard may be viewed online by following this link:

The source code and the dataset used to make the web app are available this repository.
